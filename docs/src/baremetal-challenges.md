Problem
I have a bunch of servers in two states

- Legacy state
    - Legacy infra
    - Lots of unknowns
    - Total chaos out of our control inherited from years of differents configs
    - Need to operate it on a daily basis 
    - Need to support this infrastructure as best as possible
    - Must be compliant
    - Will never evolve
    - Evolution is phaseout
        - for each system in this state there must be a contract that
            - clearly establishes the system purpose
            - defines the application owners
            - business value
                - establish contract with application owner
                - define exit strategy
                - help app owner to execute exit strategy
                - document findings so we dont re-iterate 
                - log contract in cmdb

- Cloud ready-legacy
    - Infra well defined
    - Overall architechture needs to be refined lots of missing steps
    - 

- Cloud native
    - Well defined architecture
    - Standard configs
    -
