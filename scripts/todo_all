[x] Make it self contained
    - The normal root directory is /opt/bm-dhcp-tap
    - /etc has the env files
    - /scripts has the scripts
    - /doc has the doc
    - main config name is /etc/bm-dhcp-tap.cfg in the /opt/bm-dhcp-tap root
[x] syslog streaming of all logs
[x] Have a feature where the actions are logged via syslog
[x] define syslog server port and syslog endpoint variable in config file
      - if syslog settings are not set dont enable feature
      - log local to a buffer that is 1 megabyte long rolling window
      - process when run from command line always outputs stdout and stderr
      - user can pipe do /dev/null if needed to ignore logs
[x] almost act as a daemon, identify the syslog message with
      - timestamp
      - host process is running on
      - process id
      - action level DEBUG|WARNING|INFORMATION
[x] make device OUI into a simple file that can be parsed
      - call it /etc/oui.cfg, no headers, just entries
      - OUI can be added as text with OUI prefix 22:22:22,vendor_name
      - anything not in the OUI list is ignored
[x] make sure each process has it's own log output
      - bm-dhcp-tap.py /logs/bm-dhcp-tap.log
      - dhcp_hook2.sh /logs/dhcp_hook2.log
[x] remove device OUI from code and put it in /etc/oui.cfg
